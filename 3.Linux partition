Linux partition:-
Partitioning is a methode to  allows you to divide your hard drive into isolated sections, where each section behaves as its own hard drive. 
Partitioning is particularly useful if you run multiple operating systems.
There are lots of powerful tools for creating, removing, and otherwise manipulating disk partitions in Linux.

Steps of linux partition are as follows :-

Step 1: List Partitions
Before making a partition, list available storage devices and partitions. This action helps identify the storage device you want to partition.
Step 2: Open Storage Disk
Open the storage disk that you intend to partition by running the following command:
                         sudo parted /dev/sdb.
                         
Step 3: Make a Partition Table
Create a partition table before partitioning the disk. A partition table is located at the start of a hard drive and it stores data about the size and location of each partition.
Step 4: Check Table
Run the print command to review the partition table. The output displays information about the storage device.
Step 5: Create Partition
Letâ€™s make a new 1854MB-partition using the ext4 file system. The assigned disk start shall be 1MB and the disk end is at 1855MB.
