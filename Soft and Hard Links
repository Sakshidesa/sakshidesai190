Hard Link :
A hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected file. It accesses the data available in the original file.
If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file.
Files that are hard linkedtake the same inode number.
Hard links are notallowed for directories.(Only a superuser* can do it)
Hard links are comparitively faster than soft link.
